## Context

CMS (Content Management System) are overused specially when creating blogs. A static website could respond to the need in many case which means a smaller architecture (no database) and probably a lower hosting cost.

When you are creating a documentation or synthesizing a subject you read on maybe severals articles or books, you may create a big Text document and styling it. For those need Markdown solve most of them specially if you customize a little the css or use some that was done by other (Ex: [markdown-css-themes](https://github.com/jasonm23/markdown-css-themes) )
