This project categorize 2 things that might be confusing for beginner:

- Content
- Template

In this project the content of your website is described in the Markdown file and Markdown file are sometime used as template file but that is not how it works in this project.

In this project the template is done by another file type (Twig) by default to structure how to render the content of your site. It should be possible to use something else instead.
